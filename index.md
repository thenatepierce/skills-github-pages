# Nathan Pierce's Career Development Blog

My name is Nathan, and as of 2025, I am working towards a career in Data Science from a mostly technical-support focused field.

The aim of this blog is to:
- Track and reflect the work that I do towards this goal
- (Hopefully) Showcase my skills and thought processes as I develop them

If you happen to find this and are on a similar journey, I hope that this can help provide some helpful resources and hope for you.  Career changes can be difficult, so I hope that the expereiences I share can help others as well.
